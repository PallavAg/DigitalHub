# DigitalHub
#### DigitalHub is a website made to store your favourite Movies, TV Shows, Videos and Books in one place.

The website works by pasting an IMBD, YouTube or GoodReads links and the website detects whether the link is a Movie, TV Show, Video or Book. It then parses the link to get a thumbnail and the title of the media and displays it in the appropriate column. There is also a login screen so that every user can access their data securely on any computer. 

The project was made over two months. It is written mainly in JavaScript with the website frontend in HTML/CSS which incorporated the materialize library.  Itâ€™s frontend is built using Angular and the backend uses Node.js with MongoDB as the database.

`ng serve` on the frontend and `npm start` on the backend to launch DigitalHub on `localhost:4200`
